          Whether you are a CS student at university, self-learning at home, or
          something in between, the scenario is nearly always the same. First
          you start to learn the algorithm, and at a high level it all seems to
          make sense. You can even walk through the algorithm on paper, showing
          what steps should be taken and how the state changes as the algorithm
          is used. And then when you sit down to code it everything seems to
          fall apart...

          typically happens is you get overwhelmed with smaller challenges. You

          without every single one being implemented correctly, your code will
          never work.

            I'm going to let you in a little secret - learning to code
            algorithms has more to do with how you are taught than with the
            actual material.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl py-4 leading-normal">
            Take me for example. If you were to give me a big ol' math proof for
            an algorithm, I wouldn't know where to start. There was a time long
            ago that I might have puzzled it out, but I haven't looked at math
            like that in forever. I would simply be lost.

          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl py-4 leading-normal">
            On the other hand, if you had someone explain how the algorithm
            worked without getting caught up in fancy terminology and instead
            focusing on what is actually happening and why, I'd probably start
            to get it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl py-4 leading-normal">
            Everyone learns in a different way, but there are a few common
            approaches that I have found always help people comprehend
            algorithms more successfully:

              it. When learning about an algorithm conceptually there are just
              too many details that can be glossed over, but when you code it -
              and I don't mean pseudo-code - nothing can be skimmed over and
              little details are far less likely to catch you off gaurd. You
              will also learn many tips and tricks from whoever is coding it

              In this course I am going to use all four techniques described
              above to help you learn how algorithms work, how to code them, and
              more importantly, we will learn how to take any abstract idea and
              quickly translate it into code.

              By the end of this course you might not have a CS degree, but you
              will probably understand core computer science algorithms, data
              structures, and more as well as a college graduate. And we are
              going to do it through lots of coding.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg md:text-xl py-4 leading-normal">
              You will watch me explain then code an algorithm. You will code
              the algorithms yourself. And for the later problems you will even
              find additional practice problems that you can try on your own
              then watch me solve them (<em>in case you get stuck</em> 😉).

            While you may not use every algorithm you learn here directly, you
            will use the knowledge you gain taking this course. For instance,
            your ability to take an idea you are discussing with peers and
            translate it into code will improve, your ability to tackle silly
            interview questions will improve, and you will have a better
            understanding for how the algorithms you are using might impact your
            code's performance.

                In this module we start to explore some of the sorting algorithms that exist. We will also start to examine how to do things like reverse a sorting order, recursion, divide and conquer, and we will briefly talk about Big O. If none of that makes sense to you, don't worry! We cover it all in the videos.

        Algorithms with Go was created by me -
        <a href="https://twitter.com/joncalhoun" class="underline">@joncalhoun</a>
      </p>
      <p class="pb-2">
        The Gophers were designed by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/adrianpgl" class="underline">Adrián Pérez</a>
        of
        <a href="https://friendsofgo.tech/" class="underline">Friends of Go</a>.
        They are inspired by the original Go Gopher created by Renee French.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4 italic">
        I am all for giving back to the community, but the Gophers used here are
        part of my course branding and I paid real money to have them designed.
        They are not publicly licensed, and I ask that you do not use them in
        other projects, websites, or anywhere else without first asking for my
        permission. Thanks!
